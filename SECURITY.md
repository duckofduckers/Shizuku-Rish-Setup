# Security Policy

## Supported Installation

The **only supported installation method** is using the official installer:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/duckofduckers/Shizuku-Rish-Setup/raw/main/Installer)
```

The installer always fetches the latest safe version from the repository to ensure fixes and updates are applied automatically.

Manual installation of individual files or modified scripts is not supported and may lead to undefined behavior.


---

## Uninstallation

To safely remove all installed files, use the official uninstaller:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/duckofduckers/Shizuku-Rish-Setup/raw/main/Uninstaller)
```
